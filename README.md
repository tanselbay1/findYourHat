# Find Your Hat

This is a small Javascript project completed for Codecademy Pro(Frontend Path).

## Project Goals:

In this project, youâ€™ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

## Instructions:
+ First enter required measures(Height and Width)
+ Choose a difficulty from 1 to 100
+ Move your character:* with u=Up, d=Down, l=Left, r=Right
+ ^ is your hat and you need to find and get it
+ o is a hole(stay away from them)
+ A quick note: If you move outside of the field you lose!
